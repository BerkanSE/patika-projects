# Proje 3 - Project 3
Veri yapıları ve Algoritmalar eğitiminin ilerlemesinde Binary Search Tree Projesi yapılmıştır.
Binary Search Tree Project has been made in the progress of data structures and algorithms training.

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search  tree.
